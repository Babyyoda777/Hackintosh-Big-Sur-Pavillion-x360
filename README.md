# Hackintosh-Big-Sur-Pavillion-x360
Files for my Hackintosh Laptop
Feel free to use this to cross check your own hackintosh, but by no means is this perfect.

What does work:
  Wifi
  Graphics
  Keyboard
  iServices

Doesn't work (yet):
  Camera
  Audio
  Trackpad (a big one)
  Brightness keys
  Bluetooth (traded for airdrop so doesn't matter)
